# OldPhonePad
C# Coding Challenge

# About project
This console application implements the OldPhonePad to process user inputs consisting of numbers, *, #, and spaces. 
It generates output based on predefined logic. The project is organized across OldPhonePadProcess.cs and Program.cs.

# Data Processing
This project includes a multi-dimensional array called charData, structured to hold strings that can be processed in various ways.
The data can be utilized for:
Database Storage: The contents of charData can be stored in a database, allowing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
JSON Serialization: The data can be serialized into JSON format for easy retrieval from APIs or for data interchange between systems.

# Error Handling
This project primarily emphasizes logical thinking and problem-solving to produce accurate output. 
While error handling is included, the focus is on validating input to minimize internal errors.  
If the input is a mix of correct and incorrect values, the method will return output for the correct input while returning a blank response for any incorrect entries. 
However, specific error messages can be implemented if needed.
